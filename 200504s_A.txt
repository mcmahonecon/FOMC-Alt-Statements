>> Alternative A
1. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate a further 25 basis points to 3 percent.
2. The Committee believes that, even after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains somewhat accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity.
3. Recent data suggest that the solid pace of spending growth has slowed, partly in response to the earlier increases in energy prices. Labor market conditions, however, apparently continue to improve gradually.
4. While pressures on inflation have picked up in recent months, and pricing power is more evident, longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained.
5. The Committee perceives that, with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal.
6. With underlying inflation expected to be relatively low, the Committee believes that remaining policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.
